      "content"  : "I bought this from AdagioWuyi Ensemble, known as Da Hong Pao or Wuyi rock tea, is a roasted oolong tea from the Wuyi mountains in Fujian province, China. The high fire treatment gives Wuyi oolong its specific smoky and minerally character. This is a beautifully balanced and complex tea with a deep, yet faint, ripe fruitiness in the background. The flavor is slightly honey-floral and nutty, with hints of white sesame, cinnamon, and sweetened burdock root. There is a lingering sweet caramel aftertaste due to the high fire roasting technique. Wuyi Ensemble oolong is warming and satisfying. Being a good digestive tea it goes well with food or sweets. It is perfect for multiple infusions so you can tease out many layers of intriguing flavor.            Oolong Tea      Moderate caffeine      Steep at 195° for 3-5 minutes.      "
