[I bought this from Adagio](https://www.adagio.com/decaf/decaf_earl_grey.html)

Decaf blend of tangy Ceylon black tea, flavored with bergamot - a citrus fruit. Makes a zesty cup of tea, both hot and iced. A gentle, natural decaffeination process retains the delicate shape and flavor of the tea leaves. Our decaf teas are decaffeinated using the superior carbon dioxide (CO2) process, which retains the most flavor and antioxidants.

Black Tea | Trace caffeine | Steep at 212Â° for 3 minutes.
