Earl Grey Bravo is a classic blend of artisan black tea from Sri Lanka, flavored with bergamot (a citrus fruit). The perfect afternoon tea: zesty and exhilarating fresh citrus aroma, slightly dry to the nose, with a rounded and balanced orange rind flavor to match the tang of Ceylon black tea. Our Earl Grey Bravo benefits from a pleasantly dry finish with a lingering citrus sweetness.

Black Tea | High caffeine | Steep at 212Â° for 2-3 minutes.
