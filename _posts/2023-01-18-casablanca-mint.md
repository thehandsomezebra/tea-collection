[I bought this from Adagio](https://www.adagio.com/black/casablanca_twist.html)

An interesting twist on classic Moroccan Mint tea, which traditionally combines Gunpowder green tea from China with fresh mint. We kept the latter and replaced the smoky notes of Gunpowder with the muscatel highlights of a Darjeeling from India. The result is very a refreshing cup, with bold, cool minty notes, smooth and relaxing texture and flavor. Very intriguing cup.

Black Tea | Moderate caffeine | Steep at 180Â° for 2 minutes.
