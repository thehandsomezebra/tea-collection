Wuyi Ensemble, known as Da Hong Pao or Wuyi rock tea, is a roasted oolong tea from the Wuyi mountains in Fujian province, China. The high fire treatment gives Wuyi oolong its specific smoky and minerally character. This is a beautifully balanced and complex tea with a deep, yet faint, ripe fruitiness in the background. The flavor is slightly honey-floral and nutty, with hints of white sesame, cinnamon, and sweetened burdock root. There is a lingering sweet caramel aftertaste due to the high fire roasting technique. Wuyi Ensemble oolong is warming and satisfying. Being a good digestive tea it goes well with food or sweets. It is perfect for multiple infusions so you can tease out many layers of intriguing flavor.
