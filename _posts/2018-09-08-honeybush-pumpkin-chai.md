[I bought this from Adagio](https://www.adagio.com/chai/honeybush_pumpkin_chai.html)

Masala chai spices in a South African honeybush herb base, with a hint of pumpkin. This blend of honeybush, cinnamon bark, cardamom, ginger root, cocoa nibs & safflower is sure to delight. Beautiful clear and bright cup, with a crisp and tangy-sweet flavor. The heat of the spices is balanced beautifully with the natural smooth, mellow quality of the honeybush. Naturally caffeine-free for an anytime treat. We suggest two heaping teaspoons per 6 oz cup. Sugar, cream or soy if desired.

Herbal Tea | No caffeine | Steep at 212Â° for 7-10 minutes.
