Dancong oolongs are a rare variety from Phoenix Mountain in Guangdong province, China. Our Dancong Aria (Mi Lan Xiang) is grown at an elevation of 1000 meters and exudes a perfumy aroma of orchids and almonds. Smooth and refined texture with flavors of fresh apricot, peach pit, and honey. Incredibly long finish. Dancong Aria is a tea to take your time with - for maximum sweetness use lower water temperature than for most oolongs and be careful not to over-steep it, because, for a tea that's got 'flowers' going on for days, this is no shrinking violet. A rich, grounding cup, perfect to enjoy in multiple infusions.

Oolong Tea | Moderate caffeine | Steep at 195Â° for 3-5 minutes.
