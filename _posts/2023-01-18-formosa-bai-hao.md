[I bought this from Adagio](https://www.adagio.com/oolong/formosa_fancy.html)

Formosa Bai Hao is known by many names - Oriental Beauty, White Tip Oolong, Champagne oolong, and Fancy Formosa Silver Tip, to name just a few. This heavily oxidized Taiwanese tea is one of the most prized oolongs in the world. Incredibly sweet, fruity and lush with a delicate warm spicy undertone. Striking and thought-provoking tea, perfect for multiple infusions.

Oolong Tea | Moderate caffeine | Steep at 195Â° for 2-3 minutes.
