[I bought this from Adagio](https://www.adagio.com/black/earl_grey_moonlight.html)

By popular demand, we created this Earl Grey 'cream' blend. Comforting flavors of vanilla and cream combine to soften the citrus notes of traditional Earl Grey. Your taste buds will swoon at first sip of our Earl Grey Moonlight.

Black Tea | High caffeine | Steep at 212Â° for 3-5 minutes.
