[I bought this from Adagio](https://www.adagio.com/rooibos/rooibos_earl_grey.html)

A classic blend with a twist, using South African Rooibos. Zesty fresh citrus aroma, slightly dry, with a rounded and balanced orange rind flavor. The pleasantly smooth texture from the Rooibos (not as dry and brisk as traditional Earl Grey made from black tea) lingers with citrus sweetness. Naturally caffeine-free.
