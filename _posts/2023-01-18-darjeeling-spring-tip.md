[I bought this from Adagio](https://www.adagio.com/black/darjeeling_spring_tip.html)

The Darjeeling First Flush is from the famous and beautiful Balasun estate. It is rare and exquisite in layered, complex, notes of orchard blossoms and delicate fruit crispness. It is only the eighth tea plucking of the season from very early spring and speaks to the experience and craftsmanship of the producer.

Black Tea | High caffeine | Steep at 212Â° for 3 minutes.
