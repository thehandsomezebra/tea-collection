[I bought this from Adagio](https://www.adagio.com/white/white_peony.html)


Also known as Pai Mu Tan or Bai Mu Dan, White Peony is a sweet, mild Chinese tea made from unopened tea buds, as well as the two newest leaves to sprout. The freshly harvested leaf is allowed to wither dry in the sun. The natural oxidation that takes place during this withering gives White Peony beautiful, plush flavors. The nose is warm, floral and rich like fruit blossoms. The liquor is golden and bright. Clean, succulent floral-fruit flavor, melon sweetness, a touch of gentle savoriness and rounded mouthfeel. If you are beginning your exploration of white tea, or even just tea in general, our White Peony tea will serve a wonderful introduction.

White Tea | Low caffeine | Steep at 180Â° for 3 minutes.
