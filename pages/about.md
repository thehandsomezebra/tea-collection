This website exists because in 2023 I decided that I really miss having different types of tea: and so I bought a bunch. But then I didn't know what it tasted like or what the temps to brew it at... so I made this so I can poke at it on my phone. 

Alternatively, if a guest comes over and they want some tea, this allows for a "help yourself" sort of situation with nice descriptions and pictures, if they like that sort of thing.
